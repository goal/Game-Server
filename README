This is a sample game server using clojure


Current features:

Registering a new user
user authentication



Notes:

Messages are seperated by colons. The format for messages is "function:arg1:arg2:...",
where "function" is the name of the function you wish to call.



Valid Messages:

register - takes a user name and password	register:sean:password
login - takes a user name and password		login:sean:password



Known issues:

The server is being tested using telnet, there is no client.
The database is faked and not persistant.
messages are in clear text and not optimized
passwords are not encrypted
All responses from the server are just plain text, it should have message id's
